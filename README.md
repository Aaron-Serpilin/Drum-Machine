# Software Design 
This is the template for the team project of the Software Design course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

When submitting your project, remember to make a [GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) containing the fat Jar of your project in the `out` folder here. The fat Jar is the result of the full build of your project via Gradle.

The fat Jar must be runnable using a simple `java -jar <fat jar>` command.

<--- 

In order to run the Java File, you must first cd to the java folder. From there compile the java files under the drummachine package, and then run it. Below are the commands once you are in the src/main/java folder. 

javac *.java

java Main

Following every edit on any document, the project has to be recompiled before running it again to run the current modifications.
